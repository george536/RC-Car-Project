    Test case is intended to be used in conjunction with test_connection_subscriber_1. The two test cases in combination 
    try to simulate a one to many communication scenario instead of simple 1-1. Many subscribing vehicles are
    simulated in test_connection_subscriber_1. We run that test first and wait till all vehicles successfully connect
    to the server. Then we run test_connection_publish_1 to send a message to the TEST topic. If successful all vehicles
    in test_connection_subscriber_1 should receive the message published from this unit test. Additionally, we also
    confirm to see if the test successfully published the message at the end. This helps with figuring out where
    any issue is happening.
